# COMETA - Sparse Set


# Why use an sparse set? 

Sparse sets is a data structure that has some interesting properties in terms of efficiency: 

* `O(1)` to add an item
* `O(1)` to remove an item from the list
* `O(1)` to search for an item
* `O(1)` to clear the entire set
* `O(n)` to iterate all over the set.
